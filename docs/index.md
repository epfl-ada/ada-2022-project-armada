# Cinema: a patriarchal industry?

The cinema industry has a long and complex history when it comes to the representation and portrayal of women on screen. From the earliest days of film, women have often been relegated to supporting roles or objectified as props for male characters. Despite some notable exceptions, the industry has historically been dominated by men, both behind and in front of the camera.

In this article, we will explore the place of women in the cinema industry through the lens of data from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, and additional data from the ImdB API.

We will start by providing an overview of the data available and examining how women are portrayed from different perspectives.

We will then depict the archetypal man and woman characters in films.

And finally investigate how men compare to women in terms of their roles in the industry and whether there is a noticeable difference in how movies featuring them are perceived.

## I. Overview of the data

Let's now explore the data through different point of views.

### I.1 A look at the film industry by continent

We can first gain a better understanding of the disparities in female representation in the film industry across different regions. We can anticipate that the ratio of women in the industry will vary across regions, as gender equality is not uniform across the globe.

### I.2 A gender analysis of movie genres

In this second point of view, We will analyze the representation of women in specific movie genres and consider whether certain genres have more or less gender balance in terms of characters and personnel. This will provide insight into trends and patterns of female representation in the film industry.

In this analysis, we will focus on the main genres in the film industry, including comedy, romance, thriller, drama, and action.

### I.3 A temporal analysis of female representation in the film industry

In this third perspective, we will examine how the representation of women in the film industry has changed over time. This analysis will allow us to identify any trends or patterns in the representation of women in the film industry and consider whether there has been progress towards gender equality in the industry. By looking at the data over a period of time, we can also consider the potential factors that may have influenced changes in female representation such as historical events.

[OBSERVATIONS FROM THE PLOT]

**The data reveals a disparity between the number of men and women in the film industry, regardless of region, genre, or time period, men are more prevalent than women.**

**The data shows that, over the past 60 years, there has been a gradual decrease in the gender gap in the film industry. This is likely due to the increased availability of data and the increased representation of women in the industry. Despite this progress, there is still a significant disparity between men and women in the film industry, with men still being more prevalent than women.**

It is not enough to simply look at the number of men and women in the industry to accurately assess the role of women in the industry. We must also consider the quality of their representation, which can be determined by examining the types of characters they portray and whether or not they are given leading roles. By exploring these factors, we can gain a better understanding of how gender is portrayed in the industry.

## II. The archetypical role

### II.1 Adjective

We have access to data from the CMU movie summary that shows how male and female characters are typically characterized based on the adjectives used to describe them. We can also create a report on the typical male and female character archetypes, including few features such as their ages or heights, and the frequency with which their names appear in the summary. This latter metric indicates how often the character is the main protagonist of the movie.

### II.2 Protagonist probability

We analyzed the plot summary data in the dataset and searched for character names to determine which characters are most likely to be the main protagonists. This allowed us to evaluate whether female characters are less likely to be featured prominently in the storylines.

### II.3 Other metrics

Using the actor characteristics, we can determine the average height and age of each character, and examine whether there is a difference in these attributes between main characters and non-main characters.

In this section, we focused on describing the typical male and female characters and how being a main character affects these characteristics. Another aspect we could consider is the fame of the actors portraying the characters and whether there are differences based on their gender.
