# Cinema: a patriarchal industry?

The cinema industry has a long and complex history when it comes to the representation and portrayal of women on screen. From the earliest days of film, women have often been relegated to supporting roles or objectified as props for male characters. Despite some notable exceptions, the industry has historically been dominated by men, both behind and in front of the camera.

In this article, we will explore the place of women in the cinema industry through the lens of data from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, and additional data from the ImdB API. We will start by providing an overview of the data available and examining how women are portrayed from different perspectives. We will then investigate how men compare to women in terms of their roles in the industry and whether there is a noticeable difference in how movies featuring them are perceived.
