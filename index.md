# Cinema: a patriarchal industry?

The cinema industry has a long and complex history when it comes to the representation and portrayal of women on screen. From the earliest days of film, women have often been relegated to supporting roles or objectified as props for male characters. Despite some notable exceptions, the industry has historically been dominated by men, both behind and in front of the camera.

In this article, we will explore the place of women in the cinema industry through the lens of data from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, and additional data from the ImdB API.

We will start by providing an overview of the data available and examining how women are portrayed from different perspectives.

We will then depict the archetypal man and woman characters in films.

And finally investigate how men compare to women in terms of their roles in the industry and whether there is a noticeable difference in how movies featuring them are perceived.

## I. Overview of the data

The data reveals a disparity between the number of men and women in the film industry, regardless of region, genre, or time period, men are more prevalent than women.

The data shows that, over the past 60 years, there has been a gradual decrease in the gender gap in the film industry. This is likely due to the increased availability of data and the increased representation of women in the industry. Despite this progress, there is still a significant disparity between men and women in the film industry, with men still being more prevalent than women.

It is not enough to simply look at the number of men and women in the industry to accurately assess the role of women in the industry. We must also consider the quality of their representation, which can be determined by examining the types of characters they portray and whether or not they are given leading roles. By exploring these factors, we can gain a better understanding of how gender is portrayed in the industry.
